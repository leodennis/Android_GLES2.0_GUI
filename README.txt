This program will generate a font atlas of a font, which you will be able to use.
It will also generate a font class to be used in Android (IOS coming later).

You can run the program with the TextureFontAtlas.java which includes the main or just use the .jar file.
(I will provide the Android tools to implement the font on a later date.)

You must:
 - Have the desired font installed on your device
